# Panoply: Comics and Splitscreen for Unity

Panoply is a Unity asset I designed to make it easier to create born-digital comics in Unity. The asset evolved from an authoring tool I originally built to enable the development of [Upgrade Soul](https://opertoon.com/play/detail/upgrade-soul), a digital comic written and illustrated by Ezra Claytan Daniels and published by my studio [Opertoon](https://opertoon.com). After the initial release of Upgrade Soul in 2012, I further refined and tested the tool with users, leading to its first public release in April of 2016.

Since then, Panoply has found its way into a wide variety of productions, including [Doctor Who Infinity](https://www.tinyrebelgames.com/doctor-who-infinity), [Ascent from Akeron](https://submarinechannel.com/motioncomics/ascent-from-akeron-interactive-motion-comic/), and the award-winning [Stilstand](http://niila.io/stilstand/). Indeed, the full release of Upgrade Soul was ultimately completed in 2019 using Panoply, bringing the project full circle. 

Panoply has also been used to introduce students to digital comics authoring in numerous [workshops](https://opertoon.com/play/series/visions-1), including in four sessions at the VIA Animation Workshop in Denmark. I also put Panoply to work for my two video essays about the aesthetics of digital comics: [Timeframing: Temporal Aesthetics in Digital Comics](https://youtu.be/GmJb3a2nOao), and [Space Into Game, Time Into Book](https://youtu.be/guEi-WtYX2U).

Nine years after its release, and more than thirteen years since it was originally conceived, I’ve decided that the best course forward for Panoply is to open source the code so that others can build on it. Even as digital comics have settled into a few “durable mutations,” I still believe there’s still an enormous amount of potential to be explored in the development of authoring tools which don’t just port print comics to screens, but instead help creators take advantage of all that comics and screens can do together.

Thanks to everyone who’s supported Panoply over the years — it’s been a dream come true to develop this software, and to have folks take an enthusiastic interest in it. I've still got a lot of thoughts (maybe even some good ones!) about where authoring tools for digital comics need to go, but for now I'm choosing to focus on [other endeavors](https://erikloyer.com). Cheers!

# About this release

This repo contains the last public release of Panoply and its related packages. I don’t currently have any plans to update Panoply further, though I will be monitoring the [forum thread](https://discussions.unity.com/t/released-panoply-comics-and-splitscreen-for-unity/) to answer questions and offer what help I can to current users. If you’ve got a project already in flight with Panoply, I’ll do the best I can given the limited time I have available to support you through your launch. That said, I won’t be able to offer *unlimited* support for any breaking Unity changes that might arise, so you may want to be conservative in moving to new editor versions.

Feel free to fork this repo and build on it; in general I won't be accepting pull requests here.
